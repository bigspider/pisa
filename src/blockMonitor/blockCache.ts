 * It prunes all the blocks at depth bigger than `maxDepth`, or with height smaller than the first block that was added.
 * It does not allow to add blocks without adding their parent first, except if they are at depth `maxDepth`.
 *
 * The following invariants are guaranteed:
 * 1) Adding a block after the parent was added will never throw an exception.
 * 2) No block at depth more than `maxDepth` is still found in the structure.
 * 3) No block is retained if its height is smaller than the first block ever added.
 * 4) All blocks added are never pruned if their depth is less then `maxDepth`.
 * 5) No block can be added before their parent, unless their height is equal to the height of the first added block, or
 *    their depth is `maxDepth`.
 *
 * Note that in order to guarantee the invariant (1), `addBlock` can be safely called even for blocks that will not
 * actually be added (for example because they are already too deep); in that case, it will return `false`.
